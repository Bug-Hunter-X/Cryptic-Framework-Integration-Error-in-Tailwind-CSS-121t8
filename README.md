This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using Tailwind CSS within a JavaScript framework (Vue.js in this example). The issue isn't immediately apparent as a Tailwind problem, but rather manifests as a framework-specific error message. The core problem is an undefined or misspelled Tailwind class. This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing your Tailwind configuration and ensuring all classes used are correctly defined.  The solution involves identifying the incorrect class name and either defining it or correcting the typo.
